# Abstract

Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to learn sensitive information such as login credentials or account information by sending as a reputable entity or person in email or other communication channels. Visual similarity based phishing detection techniques utilise the feature set like text content, text format, HTML tags, Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), image, and so forth, to make the decision. These approaches compare the suspicious website with the corresponding legitimate website by using various features and if the similarity is greater than the predefined threshold value then it is declared phishing.
Detection of phishing websites is a really important safety measure for most of the online platforms. So, as to save a platform with malicious requests from such websites, it is important to have a robust phishing detection system in place.
We try to build such a model a machine learning model that, given a URL it identifies whether it is a Phishing URL or not based on a pre-trained Random Forests Model.
